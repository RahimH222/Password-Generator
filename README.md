Password Generator Description for C++ Project

Project Overview:
The Password Generator project aims to create a C++ program that generates strong and secure passwords based on user-defined criteria. The generated passwords should meet commonly recommended standards for password strength, including a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

Key Features:
User Input:

The program should prompt the user for input to customize the generated password.
Users should be able to specify the length of the password.
Password Criteria:

The generator should allow users to choose from various criteria such as including uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
Users can select or deselect criteria based on their password requirements.
Random Generation:

Passwords should be generated randomly to enhance security.
Use C++'s random number generation functions to achieve this.
Strength Guidelines:

Implement logic to ensure generated passwords meet recommended strength guidelines.
For example, passwords should be of a minimum length, and they should include a mix of character types.
Output:

Display the generated password to the user.
Allow users to copy the password to the clipboard for convenience.
Error Handling:

Implement error handling for invalid user input, ensuring a smooth user experience.
Code Structure:
Main Function:

The main function should orchestrate the flow of the program.
It should handle user input, call the password generation function, and display the result.
Password Generation Function:

This function should take user criteria as parameters and return the generated password.
Use C++'s random functions to randomly select characters based on the specified criteria.
User Input Handling:

Implement functions to handle user input for password length and criteria selection.
Validate user input to prevent errors.
Output Function:

Create a function to display the generated password to the user.
Optionally, include functionality to copy the password to the clipboard.
